      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>
        We are Oleg and Karina Dermenji, and we would like to share with you our personal
        testimonies and how the Lord led us into ministry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oleg was born in a non-Christian home. His mother became a believer after divorcing
        his father because of alcoholism. When Oleg was ten years old, they began attending
        a Baptist church, but due to life circumstances they eventually stopped attending.
        During his college years, a woman from that same church invited him to a Christmas
        celebration. He was deeply impacted by how many people still remembered him by name
        and showed genuine care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through returning to church, the things he had learned about Jesus in childhood
        began to come alive again. After a season of prayer and reflection, Oleg realized
        that although he knew much about God, his life did not reflect true discipleship.
        He made a personal decision to follow Christ intentionally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Karina was also born in a non-Christian family. When she was ten years old, both of
        her parents became believers, and the family began attending an evangelical church.
        She came to faith shortly after. Today, her father serves as a pastor. From a young
        age, Karina was involved in ministry, especially among children and teenagers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oleg and Karina shared a passion for music and serving in the local church. They
        served together in the worship ministry and later got married. Around that time,
        they met missionaries serving with Cru, whose relational approach to evangelism and
        discipleship deeply resonated with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a season of prayer, God clearly confirmed their calling to full-time ministry.
        In 2012, they joined Cru staff and have continued serving faithfully ever since.
