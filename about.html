      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p><strong>We are Oleg and Karina Dermenji.</strong>
      We serve with Cru in Moldova, helping people encounter Jesus and grow as His disciples within local communities.</p>

      <p>
        We were both born and raised in Moldova, in families where faith was not always central.
        Our journeys to Christ were personal and intentional, shaped by questions, struggle,
        and a growing desire to live consistently with what we believed.
      </p>

      <p>
        During our student years, we became actively involved in local churches and ministry.
        It was there that we encountered missionaries serving with Cru.
        What struck us was their commitment to sharing the Gospel relationally
        and helping people grow in their faith, not just attend church.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, this vision became our own calling.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a season of prayer and discernment, we committed our lives to serve God full-time.
        In 2012, we joined Cru staff in Moldova and have continued serving ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, we have been involved in student ministry, digital strategy,
        and operations. Today, we serve as part of the Global Church Movement,
        with a vision to see spiritual movements everywhere — so that everyone knows
        someone who truly follows Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe the local church is God’s primary instrument for transformation.
        Our desire is to see disciples made, leaders developed, and simple faith communities
        planted in places where the Gospel is still rarely heard.
      </p>

      <p>
        We serve not as professionals with answers,
        but as a family walking faithfully with God,
        trusting Him to work through ordinary obedience.
