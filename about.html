      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p><strong>From Skeptics to Missionaries.</strong> Born in non-Christian homes in Transnistria, we both encountered Jesus during our teenage years. That transformation changed the trajectory of our lives forever. When we met missionaries who were actively sharing the Gospel and helping people grow, we knew we wanted to be part of that movement. Since 2012, we have been serving full-time with Cru to give others the same hope we found.</p>
      <p><strong>Our Family.</strong> We are not just staff members; we are a family on a mission. We are blessed with three children: Lev, Arina, and little Maria. Music is also a big part of our lives—we have been leading worship together for years, using our talents to glorify God.</p>
      <p><strong>Our Mission.</strong> Today, our hearts are grounded in Jesus. We are dedicated to walking with young people and families as they grow in faith. Our dream is to help plant a home church or fellowship group for every 1,000 people in our country, so that everyone in Moldova knows someone who truly follows Jesus.</p>
