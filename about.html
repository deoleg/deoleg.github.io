      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>
        We are Oleg and Karina Dermenji, serving with Cru in Moldova.
        Both of us grew up in non-Christian families and came to faith
        through relationships and local churches.
      </p>

      <p>
        Music and ministry were an important part of our early journey.
        Over time, God shaped our calling toward relational evangelism
        and discipleship among young people.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2012, after a season of prayer and discernment, we joined
        Cru staff and have been serving together ever since.
