      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>
        We are Oleg and Karina Dermenji. We serve with Cru in Moldova,
        helping people encounter Jesus and grow as His disciples within
        local communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were both born and raised in Moldova, in families where faith
        was not always central. Our journeys to Christ were personal and
        intentional, shaped by questions, struggle, and a desire to live
        consistently with what we believe.
      </p>

      <p>
        During our student years, we became actively involved in local
        churches and ministry. It was there that we encountered missionaries
        serving with Cru — people who shared the Gospel relationally and
        helped others grow in their faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, this vision became our own calling. In 2012, after a
        season of prayer and discernment, we joined Cru staff in Moldova
        and have continued serving ever since.
