      <h1>Partner With Us</h1>

      <p>
        We believe that God invites many people to be part of His work —
        each in different ways. Some go. Many support. All can pray.
      </p>

      <h2>Pray</h2>

      <p>
        Prayer is foundational to everything we do.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask our partners to pray for spiritual openness among people we serve,
        growth and maturity of new believers, and wisdom, faithfulness,
        and balance for our family.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are deeply grateful for those who walk with us in prayer.
      </p>

      <h2>Give</h2>

      <p>
        Financial support makes our ministry possible and allows us to serve full-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Giving is not about obligation, but about shared vision and trust
        in God’s work.
      </p>

      <h2>Stay connected</h2>

      <p>
        We value relationships, not transactions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you would like to stay connected, receive updates,
        or simply get to know us better, we would be glad to hear from you.

        You can reach us by email or connect with us personally.
