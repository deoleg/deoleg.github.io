      <h1>Partner with Us</h1>

      <p>
        Our ministry is made possible through faithful partners who pray, give, and walk
        with us as we serve people in Moldova.
      </p>

      <p>
        Partnership is not only about financial support. It is about shared vision, trust,
        and long-term commitment to seeing lives transformed by the Gospel.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are committed to regular communication and prayer updates so that our partners
        can clearly see how God is at work and how their investment is changing lives.
