      <h1>Our Ministry</h1>

      <p>
        Our ministry is focused on building spiritual movements within local communities.
        We walk alongside young people in everyday life, helping them encounter Jesus and
        grow as His disciples.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, we have served in various areas of Cru, including student ministry,
        digital strategy, and operations. Currently, we serve with the Global Church
        Movement team.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vision of Global Church Movement is to see at least one multiplying home church
        in every community of one thousand people — communities actively sharing the Gospel,
        discipling new believers, and raising leaders for future churches.
