      <h1>Ministry in Moldova</h1>

      <p><strong>Moldova is one of the least reached countries in Europe.</strong>
      Many people identify culturally as Christian, yet few have a personal relationship
      with Jesus or are part of a healthy local church.</p>

      <p>
        Decades of Soviet atheism, economic hardship, and large-scale migration
        have deeply shaped society. While churches exist, discipleship and leadership
        development remain limited in many regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cru began serving in Moldova in 1995. Today, Cru Moldova is part of a global
        movement serving in nearly 200 countries, with a shared vision to see spiritual
        movements everywhere.
      </p>

      <h2>Our focus</h2>

      <p>
        Our ministry centers on helping people move from curiosity to faith,
        and from faith to mature discipleship.
      </p>

      <p>
        We focus on relational evangelism, one-on-one discipleship,
        small group communities, and leadership development.
        We believe that faith grows best in relationships, not programs.
      </p>

      <h2>How we serve</h2>

      <p><strong>Youth and Young Adults</strong><br>
      Walking alongside young people as they navigate life, identity, and faith —
      helping them encounter Jesus, ask honest questions,
      and grow as His disciples.</p>

      <p><strong>Discipleship and Small Groups</strong><br>
      Investing in small faith communities where believers learn
      to study Scripture, pray together, and live out their faith
      in everyday life.</p>

      <p><strong>Leader Development</strong><br>
      Identifying and equipping local leaders who can multiply disciples
      and serve within their churches and communities.</p>

      <p><strong>Church and Community Engagement</strong><br>
      Working alongside local churches to strengthen sustainable,
      long-term ministry.</p>

      <h2>Our vision</h2>

      <p>
        We long to see simple, healthy faith communities planted throughout Moldova —
        so that every person would know someone who truly follows Jesus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our role is not to replace the local church,
        but to serve it, strengthen it, and walk alongside it.
