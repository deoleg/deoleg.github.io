        <h3>WIN</h3>
        <p>We actively engage with young people and professionals through English Clubs and interest-based events. These gatherings create a welcoming environment where we can build genuine friendships and share the Gospel. Whether through music, discussion groups, or personal conversations, we seek to introduce people to the love of Christ.</p>

        <h3>BUILD</h3>
        <p>We don't just share the Good News; we walk alongside those who respond. Through small groups and one-on-one mentorship, we help new believers grow in their faith, study God’s Word, and discover their spiritual gifts. Our goal is to transform converts into committed disciples who live out the Gospel daily.</p>

        <h3>SEND</h3>
        <p>We are committed to the Great Commission by empowering local leaders to start new spiritual communities. Our vision within Global Church Movements is to plant a home church or fellowship group for every 1,000 people in Moldova. We equip ordinary believers to open their homes and lead others, ensuring that everyone has access to a vital Christian community.</p>
